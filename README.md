# mpp-template-bot

This repository is a template repository for users to quickly generate bot projects.

To get started, copy the `template.env` file to `.env` and put your bot token in the file.

The `.env` file should like something like this when you're finished:

```
MPPCLONE_TOKEN=a8c86bb6e74c9ec8900e061a.82ca4028-84ac-a942-0b18-0239ac852cef
```

Obviously, this is not a real token.
